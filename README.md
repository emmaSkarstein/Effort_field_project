# Effort_field_project
A new repository for the effort field project, now including the cleaned data from the beginning and only most necessary code. 

Note that the "full_parallel_CV.R" script is quite slow and uses parallel computing, I usually run it on a server. If you want to run it sequentially, there is a variable "parallel" that changes that in the code.
